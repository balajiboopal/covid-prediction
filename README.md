# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Prediction Using Deep Learning  
**Automated Deep Learning for COVID-19 Diagnosis Using CT Scans**  

##  Overview  
This project leverages **deep learning** techniques to automate **COVID-19 diagnosis** using **CT scan images**. The model employs **VGG-16 for classification** and **U-Net for segmentation**, enabling **high-accuracy detection of COVID-19-infected lungs**. The system is built for **early detection**, reducing the workload on radiologists and improving patient outcomes.
